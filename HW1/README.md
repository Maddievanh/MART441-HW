I was expecting this assingment to be easy for me but did come across some issues. 

1. I am still struggling to understand Media Queries and responsive web design. I went through all of the refresher links, but for some reason I have a difficult time grasping the concept. There are some easy aspects to it, but I have to constantly look everything up and even seeing it in the example sites CSS file, I get confused. 

2. I have never done Parallax scrolling before, and this was also frustrating for a little bit! After figuring it out and understanding it, I will definitely be using it for future sites. 

3. I always enjoy coding, but my brain has a hard time moving on from things if I cannoy fully understand why/how they work. So sometimes I struggle with focusing on one thing for too much time. 

4. Other than my struggles, the site was very simple to make. This being the first assignment helped refresh my brain after the break.
