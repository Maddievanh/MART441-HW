              <h1> What do I do? </h1>
              <p>Currently I am a Media studies major with only about a year left until I graduate.</p>
              <p> I have worked as a nanny for 8 years, but am planning on using my degree once I graduate.
                I still am trying to figure out what I plan on trying to do, but after last semester
            I have actually found myself super interested in coding. I have been looking into web design, and might shift my focus towards that!</p>

          <h1> Interests </h1>
          <p>I absolutely love to bake. In my MART341 course, my main focus was on my own recipe page and a food review blog.
            When it comes to cooking or baking, it is my therapy. Eating it is a great perk too.

      <h1> Memory of a game </h1>
      <p>So many different games have had such a big impact on me and hold such great memories. But, Super Mario Bros on the Nintendo DS 
        holds the spot for #1 game for me. </p>
        <p> My siblings and I used to play this game every single day. Once we finally reached the very last castle we had to memorize a pattern to be able to pass through and fight Bowser.
            because our young minds couldn't quite catch on to what we were meant to do (and becoming annoyingly frustrated) my mom who was sitting and watching us struggle decided to snatch the DS
            and do the pattern herself on the first try... and won the game.

          <h1> Thoughts </h1>
          <p> One issue right now that we are facing that pertains to the media world is the usage of AI. 
            This can be scary to some, exciting to others, or both. It personally is still growing on me, and is taking some time for me to get used to it.
        I try to confront the usage of AI in a few different ways. First, I use it sparringly. I want to become familar with AI but I do not want to become reliant on it. If there is a problem
    that I can't figure out, AI is always my very last solution. To the absolute best of everyones ability, using AI ethically can benefit not only ourselves but everyone else.
Games both show us how AI issues can be resolved and the issues with it. AI is used for many video games, especially as a tool to help developers when it comes to very repetitive work/ or writers block. On the other hand, AI
cannot be as controlled when using it as a developing tool. This creates many problems for developers and recordedly many users. Though this does sound like a problem it also can help solve the issue of badly made games, and the fear of AI taking over any developing jobs. </p>
