This week was much better for me! I had a lot of fun doing this one. I used AI to help me generate images because I was unable to find that many royalty free images with exactly what I was searching for. But as AI does, each image was not exaxtly the same at all. The charcters and backgrounds changed but I did my best to try to keep it all similar. I also asked chatgpt a few questions when I was stuck like; when I was stuck on what to do for my while loop, I asked chatgpt to give me some ideas and it really helped. I also asked for some structure help. There were a few times I would accidnetally write something wrong and when I asked chatgpt it helped me find exactly what I did wrong! 


I put the entire HW prompt into chatgpt and it was an interesting outcome. Overall, the code looks almost perfect but it is missing a few things. It had no functions with parameters, and no for/while/do while/ loops. When I asked about the while loops it said that an if statement would be used better, which was super interesting! it also did not include too many different paths. Instead of questions leading to more questions, many of them just took them to the beginning of the story again.
