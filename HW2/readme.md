When using AI to create my homework, I wasd surprised that it was almost exactly the same. The only little differences is some styling. Our JS pages also were set up differently, every different question/answer was seperated whereas I kept my questions seperate but kept my answers together. 

Even though this was pretty accurate to what I did myself, I still would not feel fully confident using it. Putting practice into coding is the only way I would be able to learn. Also, for this particular assignment I could explain exactly what it put out but this is definitely not always the case. AI can use methods I have never used before, and I would not be able to confidently explain it without doing it myself. I do not think the work would still be my own. I believe getting some help is ok when using AI, I definitely have before but doing the work yourself is what makes it yours. When getting help with AI I also make sure to google their definitions/answers too, because AI is not always accurate.
