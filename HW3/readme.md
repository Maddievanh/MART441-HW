I had quite a few challenges this week. I took a lot of time studying and practicing but when it came to propery executing the homework it took me awhile. I actually ended up asking chatgpt to help me understand a lot of the concepts, which is why I have so many comments! 
This assignment became really fun when I began to understand how things worked together. I could understand the seperate concepts, but executing them all together was still a bit difficult. 
So, going over the videos a few times, using W3 and asking chatgpt for some help helped me understand. I started taking handwritten notes as well instead of on my computer (which I never thought to do for a coding class) and that really helped as well!

I asked chatgpt for help but decided to use Gemini instead when asking to write the entire assingment out. There was deffinitely many differences. The main difference I noticed was that it looked even more confusing for me! I asked a few different times and would add key words like "make this simple" or "make this easier to read" and those helped a lot, but there were so many different ways to go about this assignment and that was super interesting to look at. It also didn't always  fully understand what the HW was asking for. Instead of the buttons changing each time it was clicked, it would create three buttons, and whichever button was clicked it would have one outcome instead of creating new buttons.
