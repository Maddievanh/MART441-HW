I did not see that there is meant to be a readme this week but they help me keep track of things! 


--- This week using the HW example helped a lot, but I did a lot of tweaking to make sure everything ran smoothly. I used the JS example but wanted to make sure I wasn't only copy and pasting, so I tried to do it on my own first and when I was stuck I referred to the example. I always do this but I struggle with naming everyhting while coding! I don't know why, but the examples help a lot with that. 

I did the ChatGPT homeowrk submission out of muscle memory and it was entirely different than what I had. But there were some things before I used the example to check my work that I had chatGPT help with. It took me forever to figure out why my page 1 player info wasn't conencting to my page 3 results, so I input my code into ChatGPT and it helped pinpoint where I messed up! I tend to overlook the simple things that I think I did well and focus on the parts I know I dont know as well, and that happened to me a lot this week. It was tedious to go through the game over and over to make sure it all worked correctly, but that's a part of coding (which i had to remind myself while getting frustrated)

This was a super fun assignment though, i'm proud of how it turned out.
